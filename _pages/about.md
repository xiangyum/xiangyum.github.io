Ma Xiangyu is an assistant professor in sociology at Nanyang Technological University. His research involves the use of computational techniques to study tastes in cultural fields. His recent published work examines the way hip-hop artists' deaths function as costly signals of authenticity, durably inflating audience valuations of their antemorterm work. His writings have been published in outlets such as *Poetics* and *Cultural Sociology*. He graduated with a PhD and MA in sociology from the University of Chicago, and a BA in sociology from Pomona College.
