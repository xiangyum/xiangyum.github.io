Ma Xiangyu is an assistant professor in sociology at Nanyang Technological University. His research involves the use of computational techniques to study the processes of production, consumption, and evaluation in “cultural” markets, such as the literary arts, televisual arts, and music. His most recent work examines the semantic ambiguity around the concept of taste, and the status effects of artist's deaths in hip-hop. His writings have been published in outlets such as *Poetics*. He graduated with a PhD and MA in sociology from the University of Chicago, and a BA in sociology from Pomona College. [A copy of his most recent CV can be found here.](/files/cv/current.pdf)
